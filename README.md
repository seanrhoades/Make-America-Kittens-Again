# Make-America-Puppies-Again

((edited to use puppies instead of kittens))

This is the original code for the Kittens Chrome extension:

https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/make-america-kittens-agai/klchnmggepghlcolikgaekpibclpmgcm

.. that replaces images of Donald Trump with kittens (now puppies).

Please feel free to copy / edit / reuse the code in any way you like, but please do not use my hosted puppy images - I have to pay the S3 bill each month ;)

To use your own images, simply edit line 60 of mapa.js. Thanks.
